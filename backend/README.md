give me a step by step blueprint to build a profitable solana snipping bot for pump.fun that I can charge users 1% fee based on each trade profits they made:
- The browser will automatically create a solana wallet and private key for them
- They have to deposit like 0.1 sol at least to start trading
- The user can set the parameters like Buy Amount, Priority fee and Slippage; Sell take profit %, Stop loss %, Slippage, Timeout, priority fee, Trailing Stop loss, and they can use their own RPC link
- The bot will scan for qualified and potential coins to buy which will give returns at the moments from pump.fun (this approach, I haven't figured out yet. I need you to search online and top snipping bots how they are doing this. i was also considering adding machine learning with openai, tavily or maybe social sentiment here as well)
- It'll go ahead and buy and use the user's parameters to sell with profit.

- Getting the new token data's from pumpportal api. then i have script in typescript to swap/sell using jupiter, dflow and okxswap.
